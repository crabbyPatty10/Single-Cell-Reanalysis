## Discovery (primary)



### Figure 1 — Paired within-subject changes



![Fig 1: mito/ROS delta](assets/figures/fig1\_mito\_ros\_delta.png)



**Takeaways (discovery):**

\- We quantify \*\*within-subject change\*\* (post − baseline) to reduce between-person variability.

\- The primary readout focuses on a \*\*mitochondrial/ROS-related state\*\* in myeloid cells.

\- Group-level differences are summarized using paired deltas per subject.

### Figure 1b — Relationship to inflammation



![Fig 1b: mito/ROS vs inflammation](assets/figures/fig1b\_mito\_ros\_vs\_inflammation.png)



**Takeaways (discovery):**

\- The mito/ROS signal is compared against an inflammation-related signal to contextualize biology.

\- The plot helps separate “general inflammation” from a more specific mitochondrial/oxidative pattern.

### Figure 1c–1d — Mean delta summaries



![Fig 1c: mean ROS delta](assets/figures/fig1c\_delta\_mean\_ROS.png)



![Fig 1d: mean OXPHOS delta](assets/figures/fig1d\_delta\_mean\_OXPHOS.png)



**Takeaways (discovery):**

\- These panels provide compact summaries of mean changes in ROS- and OXPHOS-related measures.

\- Together they support the primary mito/ROS change pattern from Figure 1.

## Validation (external)



### Figure V1 — Validation cohort group comparison



![Fig V1: validation group comparison](assets/figures/figV1\_gse298464\_mito\_ros\_by\_group.png)



**Takeaways (validation):**

\- The key mito/ROS pattern is evaluated in an independent dataset (GSE298464).

\- This is a first-pass validation intended to check directional consistency.



---



### Figure V2 — Validation paired deltas



!\[Fig V2: validation deltas](assets/figures/figV2\_gse298464\_mito\_ros\_delta.png)



**Takeaways (validation):**

\- The same paired-delta logic is applied to the validation cohort where pairing is available.

\- Agreement in direction strengthens confidence that the discovery signal is not dataset-specific.
