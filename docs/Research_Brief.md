# Research Brief

Personal intellectual question:
"Why do some IBD patients fail anti-TNF therapy even when inflammation decreases--could a persistent mitochondrial/oxidative-stress state in gut myeloid cells predict nonresponse across cohorts?"

Formal research question:
"In longitudinal gut biopsy scRNA-seq from Crohn's/UC patients treated with adalimumab, does donor-level abundance of a predefined myeloid mitochondrial/oxidative-stress state persist in nonresponders after treatment, independent of IFN/TNF states, and replicate in an external anti-TNF cohort?"

### Core question
Does a portable myeloid mitochondrial/oxidative-stress state persist post-anti-TNF in IBD nonresponders (beyond inflammatory changes) and replicate across cohorts?

### Discovery dataset
TAURUS (processed myeloid-only AnnData: `myeloid_final.h5ad`) with paired sample list for longitudinal subset.

### State definition
- Module scoring: Hallmark OXPHOS, ROS, TNFA/NFKB, Inflammatory response, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma.
- State-high rule: top 20% within each biopsy sample (`sample_id`) among myeloid cells.
- Combined state: MITO_ROS-high = (OXPHOS_high AND ROS_high).

### Outputs (generated locally; not committed)
- Tables:
  - `results/tables/state_summary.tsv` (per biopsy sample)
  - `results/tables/paired_subject_deltas.tsv` (paired subject Post-Pre deltas)
- Figures:
  - `results/figures/fig1_mito_ros_delta.png` (delta MITO_ROS by response)
  - `results/figures/fig1b_mito_ros_vs_inflammation.png` (delta MITO_ROS vs delta fraction inflamed)

### Key numbers (TAURUS paired subjects)
- Paired subjects: 32 (Non_Remission n=18, Remission n=14)
- Median delta(Post-Pre) percent MITO_ROS-high:
  - Non_Remission: -1.15
  - Remission: -2.51

### Beyond inflammation quick check
- Correlation between delta MITO_ROS and delta fraction inflamed is small (~0.12).
- Simple regression: delta MITO_ROS ~ nonremission + delta fraction inflamed shows delta fraction inflamed is not strongly associated in this small sample.
- Interpretation: preliminary support that MITO_ROS change is not explained solely by inflammation change, but sample size is small.

### Next steps
1) Decide final primary endpoint (MITO_ROS vs ROS vs OXPHOS) and finalize Figure 1 style.
2) Add robustness checks (disease/site stratification; continuous scores vs percent-high).
3) Select validation cohort and build validation runner to output the same TSV schema.
