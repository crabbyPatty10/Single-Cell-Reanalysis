# Research Brief
Personal intellectual question:
“Why do some IBD patients fail anti-TNF therapy even when inflammation decreases—could a persistent mitochondrial/oxidative-stress state in gut myeloid cells predict nonresponse across cohorts?”

Formal research question:
“In longitudinal gut biopsy scRNA-seq from Crohn’s/UC patients treated with adalimumab, does donor-level abundance of a predefined myeloid mitochondrial/oxidative-stress state persist in nonresponders after treatment, independent of IFN/TNF states, and replicate in an external anti-TNF cohort?”
